You have the following two options to program your module: Drag-n-Drop Programming Using pyOCD Command Tool Requirements \u00b6 A nRF52840 M.2 Developer Kit (including nRF52840 M.2 Module and M.2 Dock) A macOS, Linux or Windows computer Prepare for Programming \u00b6 Mount the nRF52840 M.2 Module Connect the Debugger USB port to your PC using the provided USB-C Cable A disk drive called M2-DOCK will be automatically detected by the computer. Drag-n-Drop Programming \u00b6 Drag-n-Drop is an optional intuitive programming feature. It allows programming of your target MCU in a very simple way: dragging and dropping a file ( .hex -format) onto the M2-DOCK drive. There is no need to install application software. Anyone that can drag and drop a file to a USB memory stick can now program the target module. Tip Upon completion, the drive remounts. If a failure occurs, the file FAIL.TXT appears on the drive containing information about the failure. Using pyOCD Command Tool \u00b6 pyOCD is an open source Python package for programming and debugging Arm Cortex-M microcontrollers using the DAPLink debugger. It is fully cross-platform, with support for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The latest stable version of pyOCD can be installed via pip as follows. Skip the installation if pyOCD already exists. pip install -U pyocd List information about the probe connected to your computer by running: pyocd list The output should be similar as below: # Probe Unique ID -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0 ARM DAPLink CMSIS-DAP 10283602185129a100000000000000000000000097969902 The following commands demonstrate how to flash/erase the nRF52840 M.2 Module: To erase the whole flash of the nRF52840 target: pyocd erase -t nrf52840 --chip To flash the nRF52840 target with .hex -format firmware: pyocd flash -t nrf52840 Sample.hex To flash the nRF52840 target with a plain binary: pyocd flash -t nrf52840 --base-address 0x1000 Sample.bin The --base-address option is used for setting the address where to flash a binary.
