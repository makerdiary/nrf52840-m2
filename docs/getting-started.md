# Getting Started with the nRF52840 M.2 Module

## Introduction

This guide walks you through the setup and shows you how to run the Out of Box Demo without going through the complete toolchain installation. After following along with this section, you’ll be ready to start building your IoT projects.

## Requirements

* 1x nRF52840 M.2 Module
* 1x [M.2 Dock](../../m2-dock)
* 1x USB-C Cable
* A macOS, Linux or Windows computer

## Assemble the hardware

1. Make sure the M.2 Dock is powered off

2. Attach the provided 2.4GHz and NFC cabled PCB antennas to the nRF52840 M.2 module as shown in the figure below:
